# libft
##### My very first library that I created. The idea was to make a usefull library and try to recreate several functions from the famous libc library

### What is libft?

Libft is an individual project at Codam that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions. Codam makes us do this just so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. 
We are not allowed to use all libraries, that is why we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we get further in our curriculum.

### What functions are included?
